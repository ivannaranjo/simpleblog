# simpleblog
Sample ASP.NET Core app that implements a really simple (almost useless) blog engine, with storage in GCS.

This app was developed first as an ASP.NET 4.x app and then it was ported to ASP.NET Core once the necessary NuGet packages from Google were available to use from the dependencies.

There are no guarantees of anything with this app. This is not really a Google product at all.
